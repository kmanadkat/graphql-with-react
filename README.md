This repository contains code from Udemy Course of Stephen Grider: [GraphQL with React: The Complete Developers Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/graphql-with-react-course/) The course is pretty outdated but I have used latest node packages & practices throughout. I took help of official docs & ChatGPT :)

It progressed with building GraphQL Backend first & then shifted to React Frontend GraphQL integration using Apollo Client. Finally a full stack mini authentication application. It did not use Apollo Server & instead focused on more imperative library `express-graphql`.


### Exploring Repository

This repository codebase is divided into 3 folders:
1. [section-3-4-5](https://github.com/kmanadkat/graphql-with-react/tree/master/section-3-4-5) GraphQL at Backend
2. [section-6-11](https://github.com/kmanadkat/graphql-with-react/tree/master/section-6-11) GraphQL at Frontend React
3. [section-12-14](https://github.com/kmanadkat/graphql-with-react/tree/master/section-12-14) Full Stack Application

You might notice several difference between code written in course & the corresponding segment I have written. Particularly on frontend side. I have made use of hooks everywhere & have followed subjective best practices in react projects (as of 2023)

It also makes use MongoDB Atlas, I have stored MongoDB Connection URI & very few other environment variables in `.env` files (git ignored). You would find example of this files in respective sections.

Happy Learning!
